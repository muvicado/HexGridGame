Created using ChatGPT.

## Prompt
"Create a sample SwiftUI based iOS project in XCode that uses the Combine framework for updating a grid of hexagons in a SpriteKit  scene every 250 milliseconds.
The main view could be called LobbyView. It would display a button that presents a GameView that represents the main game UI."

### Notes:
You can't see it in the static screen shot, but it is updating with random colors once per second.
